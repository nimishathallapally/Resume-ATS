generate_content() Method:
The response object is expected to have attributes that store the generated content. These attributes are commonly named content or text, which are used to store the textual response generated by the model.
The content attribute typically contains the primary output of the model. It is the main response generated after processing the input.
The text attribute, if present, also contains the textual response. Sometimes, models may use different attribute names for the same or similar data, hence the check for both.
